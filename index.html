        <li><strong>June, 2008</strong> - Born with 4 siblings.</li>
        <li><strong>Nov. 2008</strong> - Was weaned from his mama and was adopted.</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Cutest kitten ever and very playful.</li>
        <li><strong>2010</strong> - Milo discovered his love for cuddling.</li>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - Caught his first mouse. I was shocked when he brought it home to me.</li>
        <li><strong>2013</strong> - Fond of straying, he found a new home with our neighbour.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - Our neighbour got a new cat from the pound. It was a female cat and Milo found love :)</li>
        <li><strong>2016</strong> - I got married and introduced Milo to my wife and of course I was abandoned for my wife. He  refused  to acknowledge me anymore.</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - We had our first kid, Sam. Milo was an adorable cat around the baby.</li>
        <li><strong>2020</strong> - Our  second baby came and she had the same colour of eyes as Milo. It was a beautiful thing to see especially when Milo was  playing the protector.</li>
        <li><strong>2021</strong> - The vet told us that Milo had cancer and he didn't have too long to live</li>
        <li><strong>Feb. 2022</strong> - Milo died and went to the end of the rainbow. He must be the most adorable cat over there. He is forever in our hearts and will be sorely missed. </li>
      </ul>
